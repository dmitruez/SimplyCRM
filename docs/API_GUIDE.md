# SimplyCRM API Guide

Welcome to the SimplyCRM public API. This document summarises how to authenticate with a personal API key and
highlights the core endpoints that power each subscription tier across the Catalog, Sales, Analytics, Automation and
Integrations modules.

> ðŸ’¡ A full, machine-readable specification is available at [http://localhost:8000/api/schema/](http://localhost:8000/api/schema/) and a live Swagger UI is
> served at [http://localhost:8000/api/docs/](http://localhost:8000/api/docs/). Use this guide as a human-friendly companion when integrating your product
> with SimplyCRM.

## Authentication

SimplyCRM uses token-based authentication. You can issue a personal API token for any user with valid credentials. The
same token can be used across every API module.

1. Obtain a token:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"username": "demo", "password": "secret"}' \
        http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token/
   ```

   Response:

   ```json
   {
     "access": "0123456789abcdef...",
     "token_type": "Token",
     "profile": {"id": 7, "username": "demo", "feature_flags": [...]} 
   }
   ```

2. Add the token to every request using the `Authorization` header:

   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Token 0123456789abcdef..." \
        http://localhost:8000/api/sales/opportunities/
   ```

3. Revoke the token when it is no longer needed:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Token 0123456789abcdef..." \
        http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token/revoke/
   ```

### Workspace API keys

Organizations on Enterprise plans can mint long-lived workspace keys via the Integrations module:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Token ..." -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Data warehouse", "permissions": ["sales.read", "catalog.write"]}' \
     http://localhost:8000/api/integrations/api-keys/
```

Each workspace key can be scoped to fine-grained permissions. They are returned only once upon creation, so store them
securely. Use them exactly like personal tokens.

## Base URLs

Every product area exposes a dedicated namespace under `/api/`:

| Module        | Base path                | Description |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| Catalog API   | `/api/catalog/`         | Products, variants, suppliers, inventory, price history |
| Sales API     | `/api/sales/`           | Companies, contacts, pipelines, deals, notes, files |
| Analytics API | `/api/analytics/`       | Dashboards, metric definitions, forecasts, AI insights |
| Automation API| `/api/automation/`      | Campaigns, rules, notifications, webhook events |
| Integrations API | `/api/integrations/` | API keys, connectors, webhooks, import jobs |
| Assistant API | `/api/assistant/`       | AI conversations and knowledge retrieval |

All endpoints continue to be available under the aggregated `/api/<resource>/` paths for backwards compatibility, but
new integrations should prefer the namespaced URLs above for clarity.

| Pro           | `POST /api/assistant/ai/conversations/{id}/ask/` | Submit prompts and receive context-rich answers. |

## Error handling & rate limits

Responses follow standard HTTP semantics. A `401 Unauthorized` indicates a missing or invalid token, while `403
Forbidden` means the workspace lacks the feature flag required for the endpoint. 429 responses include a `Retry-After`
header.

Rate limits are enforced per token and per IP, aligning with your subscription's API quota. Contact support for custom
quotas or burst allowances.

## Testing your integration

For quick smoke tests you can use the included Postman collection or rely on curl scripts. Always create a dedicated
workspace API key for production automation and rotate it regularly using the Integrations API.
